# üìú About Me
I'm Manoj Ankireddy, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Kansas, passionate about software development, machine learning, and full-stack web development. With a background in Data Structures and Algorithms, computer vision, deep learning, and data privacy. I have industry experience as a Software Engineer at Infosys, where I contributed to database migration and automation solutions, as well as a Machine Learning internship at Dhaapps. My expertise spans backend technologies (Node.js, Spring Boot), frontend frameworks (React, Angular), and AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Beyond my technical skills, I have a strong passion for teaching and mentoring, having worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for programming courses and streamlined student grading processes with automation. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing table tennis, designing creative content, and exploring new technologies. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to create impactful solutions.

I am **Innovative**, **Scalable**  and **Efficient**.

## üöÄ Projects



- **[Data Anonymizer App](https://github.com/Manojreddy-2k/data-anonymizer)**  
‚Ä¢ Developed a web application using the ARX API to anonymize personal datasets, addressing privacy concerns and compliance
with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA), and containerized the solution using Docker for scalable deployment.
‚Ä¢ Implemented privacy-preserving techniques , allowing users to select configurations and parameters for data de-identification.
‚Ä¢ Built an intuitive interface with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX, and integrated backend technologies like Java (Spring Boot)
and MySQL enabling users to upload datasets, configure settings, and download anonymized outputs.
**Technologies Used:** Java, REST APIs (JAX-RS), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ARX API, Apache Tomcat .

- **[Built LLM from Scratch](https://github.com/Manojreddy-2k/Large-Language-Model-LLM-from-scratch)**  
‚Ä¢ Developed an LLM encoder in Scala and trained the model on the cloud.
‚Ä¢ Generated Byte Pair Codings (BPE‚Äôs) for training data set using Jtokkit, map-reduce and deployed the pipeline successfully using
AWS-EMR for distributed processing.
‚Ä¢ Trained the decoder neural network with Apache Spark, implemented an attention mechanism, and validated model performance.
‚Ä¢ Deployed the model as a step function on AWS Lambda and integrated it with AWS API Gateway.
  **Technologies Used:** Scala, Deeplearning4j, Docker, Map-Reduce, Spark, AWS(EMR, S3, Lambda

- **[Real-Time Temperature Prediction Using Edge AI and TinyML](https://github.com/Manojreddy-2k/real-time-temperature-prediction)**  
‚Ä¢ Developed an LSTM model to predict temperatures one hour ahead, achieving a low RMSE of 0.025. Preprocessed data through
normalization and converted the model to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on the XIAO ESP32S3 microcontroller.
‚Ä¢ Optimized the system for edge devices, enabling real-time predictions with an inference latency of 0.584 seconds. Demonstrated
applications in agriculture and smart cities, showcasing low-power AI solutions for IoT environments.
  
  **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow Lite, LSTM.
