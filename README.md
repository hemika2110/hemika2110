# üìú About Me
I,m Hemika Amilineni, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Kansas, passionate about software development, machine learning, and full-stack web development. With a background in Data Structures and Algorithms, computer vision, deep learning, and data privacy. I have industry experience as a Software Engineer at Infosys, where I contributed to database migration and automation solutions, as well as a Machine Learning internship at Dhaapps. My expertise spans backend technologies (Node.js, Spring Boot), frontend frameworks (React, Angular), and AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Beyond my technical skills, I have a strong passion for teaching and mentoring, having worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for programming courses and streamlined student grading processes with automation. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing table tennis, designing creative content, and exploring new technologies. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to create impactful solutions.

I am **Innovative**, **Scalable**  and **Efficient**.

## üöÄ Projects



 AI Candidate Evaluator | Python, Flask, NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, HTML/CSS
 ‚Ä¢ Developed an AI-powered resume screening tool using Python and Flask, integrating NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy) and
 machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras) to automatically parse resumes, extract key skills, and
 evaluate candidate experience.
 ‚Ä¢ Engineered robust data processing pipelines with Pandas and NumPy and implemented a responsive web interface with
 HTML/CSS, streamlining the candidate evaluation process and reducing manual screening time..

Fraud Detection-Credit Card Transactions | Python
 ‚Ä¢ Developed a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection using both supervised and unsupervised algorithms.
 Implemented models such as XGBoost, Balanced Random Forest, and autoencoders to minimize false negatives.
 ‚Ä¢ Conducted data analysis on imbalanced datasets and optimized model parameters, achieving a highly effective fraud
 detection system with minimal errors.

- **[Real-Time Temperature Prediction Using Edge AI and TinyML]  
‚Ä¢ Developed an LSTM model to predict temperatures one hour ahead, achieving a low RMSE of 0.025. Preprocessed data through
normalization and converted the model to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on the XIAO ESP32S3 microcontroller.
‚Ä¢ Optimized the system for edge devices, enabling real-time predictions with an inference latency of 0.584 seconds. Demonstrated
applications in agriculture and smart cities, showcasing low-power AI solutions for IoT environments.
  
  **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow Lite, LSTM.


## üíº Work Experience

- **University of Kansas(August 2024 ‚Äì present)**  
  *Graduate Teaching Assistant | Lawrence, Kansas 
  - Developed Python scripts to automate grading for multiple coding assignments, streamlined grading workflows for teaching
assistants, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reducing grading time by 200%

- **Accenture (October. 2022 ‚Äì October 2023)**  
  *Software Engineer 
   ‚Ä¢ Trained in Java full stack development.Worked on Java web development using java servlets, JPA Spring core and
 springboot.As part of a team, I contributed to building a scalable e-commerce platform by developing a RESTful API
 using Spring Boot for data storage and backend functionality and optimized workflow automation scripts, increasing
 application efficiency by 30 percent . Conducted debugging, troubleshooting, and code reviews to ensure quality and
 maintainability.Created data reports using Excel pivot tables and SQL queries. Collaborated with cross-functional teams
 to develop scalable solutions for enterprise applications.
 ‚Ä¢ I was responsible for the creation and maintenance of multiple Java software projects leveraging core Java, Spring Boot,
 and the RESTful API design aspect.Designed and implemented MVC architecture. Efficiency of the application increased
 by 30 percent by removing the inefficiencies in the code through best development practices
